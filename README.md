# Employee Management CMS Tool

## Description

In this project I have created a command line application that connects to a local mySQL database and allow a user to manage departments, roles and employees within an organisation through interactions with the database.

## What I have done

- [x] Created the schema for the database that allows the user to initialise it on their local database server
- [x] Created seed files for the database to enable testing of functionality
- [x] Created a utility class that manages interactions with the mySQL database and is reusable in other applications
- [x] Added a package.json file to manage dependencies
- [x] Added functionality to create, read, update and delete data
